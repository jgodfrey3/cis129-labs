print('Once upon a time there was a small spider down by the lake.')
print('The little spider was climbing across very big rake.')
print('A farmer came by, fetching water for the night')
print('But he stepped on the rake and sent it upright'!)
print('The farmer soon after filled his bucket to the brim;')
print('But the poor little spider was sent for a swim.')
